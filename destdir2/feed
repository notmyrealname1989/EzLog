<p>Reaction on the forums is mixed.  Some feel that Shihada was just a loudmouth who got what was coming to him, while others view him as a hero.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a new Jamestown <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2374307&referer=');urchinTracker('/outgoing/jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2374307&amp;referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_status=draft');" href="http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2374307">article</a>, Michael Scheuer has refined some of the arguments he made in May in response to the al-Qaeda-is-almost-defeated meme that has been going around since April.  He and I had a brief exchange about it <a href="http://www.jihadica.com/aq-on-the-ropes/">here</a> (look in the comments), so I won&#8217;t reprise all of it.  But I do want to offer a counterpoint to his remarks on Saudi Arabia and Salafis.</p>
<p>In his new article, Scheuer asserts that the Western press has bought the idea that al-Qaeda is near defeat. Journalists, he says, have bought it because some Islamist ideologues who previously supported al-Qaeda have criticized the organization.  (Scheuer calls these criticisms &#8220;recantations,&#8221; but only a few of the people he mentions have recanted.)  These criticisms, Scheuer says, &#8220;are part of a bigger project conducted by several Arab states&#8211;led by Saudi Arabia&#8211;to make the United States and its allies believe Islamism&#8217;s strength is ebbing.&#8221;  This idea has been picked up by the Western media because people in the West &#8220;desperately wants to believe such claims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is Saudi Arabia conducting this campaign?  To divert attention from the real problem, Salafism, which Scheuer calls &#8220;Saudi Arabia&#8217;s state religion.&#8221;  The Saudis have even gone so far as to reach out to the pope and to consider the building of a church in the kingdom, all in the hopes that the West will forget that its religious ideology is the &#8220;engine of contemporary jihad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The West has a lot to be worried about, Scheuer says (quoting an al-Ahram article by Khalil El-Anani), because Salafism is gaining ground:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salafis won a majority of parliamentary seats in Kuwait</li>
<li>A Salafi is the head of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan</li>
<li>Salafis are running the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt</li>
<li>Hamas hawks have more power than Hamas pragmatists</li>
</ul>
<p>Al-Qaeda will be defeated, Scheuer concludes, when Salafism is removed &#8220;from schools and missionary activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I said in my earlier exchange with Scheuer, I agree with him that al-Qaeda is not near defeat, but I don&#8217;t think the al-Qaeda-is-near-defeat meme is a bad thing.  The U.S. wins against al-Qaeda when it is no longer able to recruit or when the morale of its members becomes too low.  One of the ways to achieve this is to create the public perception that al-Qaeda is losing. As long as the analytical community does not let this public perception cloud its judgment, I&#8217;m all for it.  (Incidentally, I do think 2007 and 2008 have been rotten years for al-Qaeda in the Middle East proper.)</p>
<p>Scheuer&#8217;s assertion that the Saudis are leading a &#8220;project&#8221; to push this idea and to distract the West from its support for Salafism is too conspiratorial.  The U.S. stands to gain as much as the Saudis do from exposing al-Qaeda setbacks to public view.  Moreover, I would look a little closer to home for the idea&#8217;s origin.  Finally, what in the world is wrong with Saudi leaders reaching out to the pope and considering the building of a church in the kingdom?</p>
<p>As for Salafism and its spread, there is less coherence to the movement than Scheuer makes out.  Salafism is an ecumenical, originalist, Protestant-like movement in Sunni Islam whose followers reject adherence to the four traditional schools of law.  But under this wide rubric, you find a great deal of variety.  Wahhabis (a better term for the followers of the official religious ideology of the Saudi state) and the Ahl-e Hadith in Pakistan are Salafis under my definition, but they have very different attitudes toward politics.  And it&#8217;s the attitude toward politics that should concern analysts the most.</p>
<p>A further problem with the label &#8220;Salafi&#8221; is that it says little about a group&#8217;s beliefs or political orientation.  Many Sunni groups call themselves &#8220;Salafi&#8221; because the word signals that their beliefs are derived from Islam&#8217;s &#8220;pious founders&#8221; (Ar. <em>salaf</em>).  But that&#8217;s almost like of a Sunni calling himself an &#8220;authentic Muslim,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t give you a good idea of his religious or political attitudes (Thomas Hegghammer has made this point elsewhere).  Take the Muslim Brothers in Kuwait for example.  They sometimes call themselves Salafis, but they are usually at odds with self-described Salafi political parties in that country.</p>
<p>As an aside, Salafis in Kuwait did not win a majority of seats in that country&#8217;s recent parliamentary elections, as Scheuer&#8217;s al-Ahram source asserts.  They took 7 seats by my <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/www2.gsu.edu/_polmfh/database/maj200800f2.htm?referer=');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www2.gsu.edu/_polmfh/database/maj200800f2.htm?referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_status=draft');" href="http://www2.gsu.edu/~polmfh/database/maj200800f2.htm">count</a>.</p>
<p>Scheuer took this point and several others from op-eds written by Arab secularists.  For someone who berates the Western media for accepting ideas from Arabs who have agendas, he might view his own sources with a little more skepticism.  Lumping every Islamist into the same Salafi stew may make a complex phenomenon more digestible or satiate the reading public&#8217;s appetite for ubiquitous doom, but it is neither analytically accurate nor politically useful.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ekhlaas member al-Suhayl observes that JIhadis criticize Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and other Arab countries for collaborating with the United States, but they say nothing about Oman.  Moreover, Oman has not been the object of Jihadi violence.  This despite the fact that Oman allows the U.S. to use its military bases, has an office for Omani-Israeli relations, has a constitution that violates Sharia law, and has reformed its curriculum to conform with &#8220;Bushi-Blairi&#8221; Islam.</p>
<p>Abu al-Usud al-Saffak (The Blood-shedding Father of Lions) responds that Jihadis come from every country of the world except Oman.  He&#8217;s at a loss to explain it.</p>
<p>Suhayl concurs, remarking: &#8220;One of the mujahids said: &#8216;There are two countries from which mujahids do not originate: Oman and Bahrain.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>`Adhab al-Qabr (Torment of the Tomb) believes that the reason for Oman&#8217;s lack of Jihadi production is the Ibadi ideology that dominates religious matters.  (This would be ironic given that I<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadi" onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadi?referer=');">badism</a> is a soft remnant of the revolutionary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharijite" onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharijite?referer=');">Kharijite Movement</a> that roiled the early Islamic empire&#8211;a movement often compared to contemporary Jihadi-Salafism.)  `Adhab&#8217;s solution is that the brothers need to start joining Omani forums and spreading Jihadi ideas.</p>
<p>Al-`Adiyyat (Antiquities) complains that he has already done so, but to little effect.  Even the non-Ibadis in Oman are not interested because they are too taken with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism" onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism?referer=');">Sufism</a>.</p>
<p>The absence of Jihadi foreign fighters from Oman and the dearth of Jihadi activity in Oman does need explanation.  It has the right ingredients&#8211;authoritarian rule, no civil rights, a revolutionary and misanthropic ideology, and a U.S. presence&#8211;but no cake.  Perhaps there needs to be more ingredients.  Or perhaps the ingredients have to be mixed in specific portions (i.e. Oman lacks the right recipe).  At the very least, the absence challenges to the standard cultural or political explanations for Jihadi violence.  Any takers?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The motives of the Sunni Muslim youth fighting in the Bab al-Tabbana neighborhood of Tripoli, Lebanon continues to animate discussion on Ekhlaas.</p>
<p>One poster, Hafidat Usama (Granddaughter of Usama), claims to live in Bab al-Tabbana and to have witnessed the fighting.  Hafidat asserts that the youth only armed themselves after seeing that the Lebanese army was not able to enter the neighborhood.  Although the youth could not match the heavy weaponry of their `Alawi opponents, they manged to fight them to a standstill.</p>
<p>Hafidat is annoyed with Umm al-Faruq, another female Ekhlaas member, who accused the Tabbana youth a few days ago of fighting for Saad al-Hariri&#8217;s Future Movement and of not being properly pious in their appearance or behavior.  Hafidat shoots back that the youth were only fighting to protect their religious community and not for political reasons.</p>
<p>Another member, Abu Hajir al-Kinani, counsels caution, explaining that Jihadis living outside of Tripoli are worried that the youth there are risking prison or death for the sake of political causes that are not their own.</p>

One article caught my eye:  &#8220;Somalia&#8230;The Forgotten Land.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jihadica.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sada-al-jihad-27.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-204" title="sada-al-jihad-27" src="http://www.jihadica.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sada-al-jihad-27-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="33" height="33" /></a> Issue 27 of Sada al-Jihad (The Echo of Jihad) is also out.  SJ is produced by the Global Islamic Media Front.  A few articles look interesting: &#8220;Al-Qaeda Is a Stone&#8217;s Throw From Palestine,&#8221; &#8220;Apostates Are More Dangerous Than the Enemy,&#8221; and &#8220;Interrogation (Methods and Phases).&#8221;</p>

The periodical focuses mainly on Iraq and most of this issue is about various attacks and prison breaks.  There is one article worth noting: &#8220;The Camera: A Weapon Without Bullets.&#8221;</p>
<p>* Note: Hisad (&#8221;harvest&#8221;) seems to make more sense than Hassad (&#8221;harvester&#8221;) for the title, but that&#8217;s how the .pdf file is vocalized, so I&#8217;m going with it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon that is.  Over the past few days, there has been fighting between the Jabal Muhsin and Bab al-Tabbana neighborhoods that has killed a handful of people and injured dozens.  The former is predominantly Alawi and the latter is Sunni.</p>
<p>The clash has prompted confused speculation on Ekhlaas.  No one is sure who is fighting or who to root for. Abu_3ubayda puts it best when he says, &#8220;The resistance now is spontaneous and unorganized. What has happened so far is improvised.&#8221;</p>
<p>One point of contention is the extent of <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43173&referer=');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43173&amp;referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/edit.php');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43173&amp;referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=198&amp;message=4');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43173&amp;referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post-new.php');" href="http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=43173">Salafi involvement</a>.  Some members say that most of the Sunnis fighting are Salafis, while others deny it.</p>
<p>Bab al-Tabbana is said to be a stronghold of Salafism in Tripoli, where the puritanical Sunni movement has become powerful, if fractured, in recent years.  Still, <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/06/analysi_fears_o.php?referer=');urchinTracker('/outgoing/yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/06/analysi_fears_o.php?referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/edit.php');urchinTracker('/outgoing/yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/06/analysi_fears_o.php?referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=198&amp;message=4');urchinTracker('/outgoing/yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/06/analysi_fears_o.php?referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post-new.php');" href="http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2008/06/analysi_fears_o.php">not every Sunni taking up arms</a> in the neighborhood identifies as a Salafi.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we left Harbi, he had met a Algerian Jihadi who told him how to get to Iraq.</p>
<p>According to Furqan al-Junubi&#8217;s account, Harbi and two other Kuwaitis&#8211;Abu Salih (`Abd Allah Salih al-`Ajami), and Abu Talha (Nasir) al-Dawsari&#8211;pledged to go to Iraq and die there.  They called this &#8220;The Pledge of the Houris&#8221; (the virgins promised to those allowed to enter Paradise&#8211;martyrs are a shoe in).  Al-Miskin al-Muhajir was with them, but he could not go due to personal circumstances (he was able to go to Afghanistan latter&#8211;see <a href="http://www.jihadica.com/walking-the-talk-forum-members-travel-to-afghanistan-and-iraq-part-1/">part 1</a>).</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been able to find much on Dawsari, but there&#8217;s plenty on `Ajami.  He was actually being held in Guantanamo until the U.S. transferred him to Kuwaiti custody in 2005; the Kuwaits acquitted him of all charges.  By the time `Ajami met Harbi, <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.rferl.org/content/article/1117436.html?referer=');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.rferl.org/content/article/1117436.html?referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=192&amp;message=4');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.rferl.org/content/article/1117436.html?referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post-new.php');" href="http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1117436.html">he was married, had one child, and was financially comfortable</a>.  Those who knew him thought he had been rehabilitated.</p>
<p>After several days, the three men departed for Iraq.  Junubi relates that Harbi left behind a large house, eight children (now ten), and a substantial sum of money. (Harbi was a car salesman.  From the looks of <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=88b256EdY6k&referer=');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=88b256EdY6k&amp;referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=192&amp;message=4');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=88b256EdY6k&amp;referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post-new.php');" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88b256EdY6k">this, </a>he also seems to have been a racing enthusiast. You can see Harbi at the 0:38 mark.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jihadica.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/harbi-with-nephew.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-195" title="harbi-with-nephew" src="http://www.jihadica.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/harbi-with-nephew-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Before Harbi left, Junubi, the author of our account, wrote and wished him well.  Harbi replied that they would soon meet in Paradise.  Harbi&#8217;s response was dated April 5, 2008, which is probably after he had left Kuwait (one of his traveling companions, `Ajami, died in late March).</p>
<p>Junubi relates that the three men wen to Iraq through a coordinator, but he doesn&#8217;t say where their transit point was.  It has now come to light that the men went through <a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/William/Application%20Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/nyc8q52x.default/zotero/storage/13737/index.html">Syria</a>. Indeed, one of the last photos of Harbi was taken by himself on the flight to Syria.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jihadica.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/harbi-on-plane-to-syria.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-193" title="harbi-on-plane-to-syria" src="http://www.jihadica.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/harbi-on-plane-to-syria-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>According to press reports, `Ajami called his family from Syria to tell them where he was headed and why.   The next time they would hear news of him was when they received an anonymous call informing them that `Ajami had carried out a suicide bombing.  Harbi&#8217;s family got the same call a few weeks later.</p>
<p>According to a Furqan video that was posted on June 21, `Ajami carried out a March 23 suicide attack on the Harmat neighborhood of Mosul.  A little over a month later, Harbi carried out an April 26 attack on the Tel al-Rumman police station in Mosul.  (Bill Roggio at <em>Long War Journal</em> has a good <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/06/released_guantanamo.php?referer=');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/06/released_guantanamo.php?referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=192&amp;message=4');" href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/06/released_guantanamo.php">summary</a> of the contents, based partially on Nibras Kazimi&#8217;s analysis).</p>
<p>The video is over 30 minutes long and tedious in parts, but many of the useful bits can be viewed <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdj-Mytp2IM&referer=');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdj-Mytp2IM&amp;referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=192&amp;message=4');" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdj-Mytp2IM">here</a>.  Harbi is the bearded, long-haired man in the center of everything (his coiffure and beard seem to be deliberately modeled on that of Khattab, a Jihadi commander in Chechnya that Harbi emulated, according to Junubi).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jihadica.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/harbi-as-khattab.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-196" title="harbi-as-khattab" src="http://www.jihadica.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/harbi-as-khattab-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>The first clip you see is that of Harbi talking about jihad and then chanting a nashid (hymn) with his brethren (notice the childrens&#8217; voices in the background).  The next clip is Harbi standing next to the vehicle he will use to blow himself up. After that is his attack on Tel al-Rumman, followed by `Ajami&#8217;s attack on the Harmat neighborhood.  Last is Harbi again leading a group chanting a hymn.</p>
<p>In the full video, Harbi gives his final testament (wasiyya), summarized <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.alwatan.com.kw/Default.aspx?MgDid=643042_amp_pageId=35&referer=');urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.alwatan.com.kw/Default.aspx?MgDid=643042_amp_pageId=35&amp;referer=http://www.jihadica.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=192&amp;message=4');" href="http://www.alwatan.com.kw/Default.aspx?MgDid=643042&amp;pageId=35">here</a>.  In it, he criticizes a hardline Kuwaiti Salafi scholar, Hamid al-`Ali, for badmouthing the Islamic State of Iraq.  He then explains to his family that he decided to leave for Iraq because the Companions of Muhammad did not choose to sit with their families when fighting was called for.  (Harbi may have been feeling a little guilty&#8211;Junubi tells us that his mother was very ill when he left.)  Harbi then chastizes other Jihadis for sitting behind their computers and doing nothing.</p>
<p>At the end of his testament, Harbi stands next to his car bomb.  As he pats the explosive tank, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have everything: a house, a car, two wives, and eight children.  But now I find happiness in my heart that I did not find in any other place.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to talk about here and it probably deserves a separate post, but just few closing thoughts to end the series:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mixture of indignation, glory seeking, camaraderie, and promise of eternal reward motivated Harbi and `Ajami to pledge themselves to die in Iraq.  Since both had been detained and likely treated harshly, they may have been motivated by a desire for personal revenge as well.</li>
<li>Syria is the transit point for our group, as it is for many other Gulfis seeking martyrdom in Iraq.  But note that it is an Algerian Jihadi, not a local Kuwaiti, that informs the Kuwaiti group of the route.</li>
<li>After reading Junubi&#8217;s account, one Ekhlaas member asked 1) why Harbi went to Iraq rather than Afghanistan and 2) why he chose to be a martyrdom operative when he had enough experience to be a trainer. In other words, why didn&#8217;t a skilled Jihadi like Harbi put his talents to better use.   Junubi answers that Harbi went to Iraq because it is much easier to travel there than to Afghanistan.  Moreover, many go to Iraq because it is close by.  On the second question, Junubi discloses that Harbi had thought about becoming a coordinator but decided he wanted to die a martyr and not fight (presumably since the latter did not guarantee martyrdom).</li>
