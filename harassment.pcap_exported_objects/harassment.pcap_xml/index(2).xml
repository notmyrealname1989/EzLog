         <title>proof of concept?</title>
         <description><![CDATA[The people who pay for the widgets can't/not talking to the people who make the widgets: <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3632342&c=AME&s=TOP">the guys who need to use widgets end up paying the price</a>. How could TT 2.0 fix this?

<ul>
<li>If legal interpretations are going to change with administrations, there can be no guarantee that formal sit-downs on problem programs, much less for general purposes will take place with regularity. This is a serious problem for efforts that run 5, 10 years or more. It negatively impacts trust, leads to communications breakdowns, which exacerbates current problems and creates new ones. TT 2.0 as an assembly of those with .mil and .com experience who can act as sounding board and honest broker ensures a stable and trusted comms path.</li>
<li>In that honest broker role, TT 2.0 can serve as the "Gartner" or "Forrester" for defense (and perhaps later IC) offices and programs looking for advice and guidance on what tech or strategic paths to follow. Helps avoid falling victim to <a href="http://www.drunkendata.com/?p=1806 ">"nobody ever got fired"</a> syndrome.</li>
<li>As a more accessible entity, TT 2.0 can also take into consideration practitioner and engineer input that would most likely be ignored by high-level panels. This is not about real or perceived corruption or temptation, but a more-minds-better-solutions thing. The filter from field to mahogany row can be severe.</li>
</ul>

No shortage of possible participants, and of course the technology is here, but the 800 lbs gorilla is how to pay for it. Mix of gov and corporate dollars (fixed and aggregated to reduce external influence) is one option. Now, if only we had a proponent . . .

         <title>because another czar will make all the difference</title>
         <description><![CDATA[When one of your nat-sec advisors used to be the cyberterror czar, <a title="technewsworld: Obama Calls for Cyberterror Czar" href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/63842.html">this is not surprising</a>.

Given that "cyberterror" is actually un-terrifying, it makes more sense to try and tackle what terrorists are doing online: communicating and making money. In other words: cyber crime and the digital black globalization the enables it.

 . . . Wow. Now that I put it that way, and given that we're on our third 5-year rota of "getting serious" about cyber crime, it kind of seems hopeless/pointless . . .

Still waiting for the original thinking in this space. What is clear – at the risk of drawing a real/cyber world metaphor – is that the too-few Marshals to cover too much territory model of policing the wild frontier of cyber space isn't working. We can <a title="CCSA: Buccaneer.com – PDF)" href="http://www.cyberconflict.org/pdf/CCSAJournal.pdf">fight the digital hoard with a hoard of our own</a>, or we can let the brigands run roughshod over us and wonder why we ever left the old (analog) country.
