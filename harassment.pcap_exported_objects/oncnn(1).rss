      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-48207?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>This is a picture of a barn that had it's roof blown off by the
storm that ripped through parts of Vermont on Friday July 18, 2008.
This photo was taken on rt 108 in Cambridge near Bakersfield
Vermont. I took this photo today Monday July 21, 2008. Story told
to me is that they were milking cows when the storm lifted the
roof. No injuries were reported. Notice the person in the roofless
barn.</description>

      <title>Rebuilding the Gulf Coast. Zoo Northwest Florida. Part One</title>
      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-48179?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>&lt;br /&gt;iReport for CNN "Rebuilding the Gulf Coast" 
&lt;br /&gt;The struggles of The Zoo Northwest Florida 
&lt;br /&gt;You might call it the little zoo that could take the beating
of three major hurricanes and still keep going. But the momentum
that's kept The Zoo Northwest Florida afloat through some of the
toughest times in recent history along the Gulf Coast, is quickly
fading to economic hard times. 
&lt;br /&gt;Located about 150 miles east of Biloxi, Mississippi, you'll
find the small zoo in Gulf Breeze, Florida. Biloxi is where the eye
of Hurricane Katrina, a Cat 5 storm, plowed onto shore on Aug. 23,
2005. Even though this zoo was not in the direct path of this
storm, the effects - wind, rain and loss of tourism dollars - were
still felt. A few months before Katrina hit, the zoo, which is just
a few miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico, was dealt a mighty blow
from the eye of Hurricane Denise, a Cat 3 storm that knocked down
hundreds of trees, flooded coastal properties and derailed tourism.
These two hurricanes could not have come at a worse time. The zoo
was still trying to repair and financially recover from one of the
worst hurricanes to hit this area in recent history -- Hurricane
Ivan, a deadly Cat. 5 storm that brought the Pensacola and Gulf
Breeze areas to its knees. The zoo was in the direct path of the
northeast quadrant of the hurricane...the worse side of this
massive storm. 
&lt;br /&gt;So I don't need to tell you that this Zoo has had its share
of struggles. It seemed as though every time it was getting back on
its feet, another storm would makes its presents known. And each
time the struggles grew harder, to the point that today The Zoo
Northwest Florida might have no other choice than to close its
doors and start yet another struggle to find homes for more than a
1,300 animals. For a community that's still in the recovery stages
from the one, two, three punches of the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes,
this would be a big blow. 
&lt;br /&gt;This beloved zoo has been a large part of this community for
many years. A non-profit zoo that has made ends met with ticket
sales, corporate and private supporters, fund raisers and
donations, including penny drives from local school children. And
many of these children are ones who lost everything during
hurricanes Ivan and Dennis. Unlike many zoos that have the support
of their local city, county and state governments, this zoo
operates solely on its own. 
&lt;br /&gt;But its battle to keep the doors open and animals here is at
the 11th hour. If the local city and or county government can't
find room in their budgets, the zoo has no other choice but to put
a lock on its doors and spend the next projected 12 to 16 months
finding homes for all of the animals that range from large exotics,
such as giraffes, lions, gorillas and a chimpanzee named Zackary,
who waves and smiles at visitors, all the way down to the smallest
of bats and snakes. 
&lt;br /&gt;I grew up in this area and like many people here, we feel a
kinship with the zoo and its animals - some of which have been born
at the zoo. I have attended events here, taken my nephews and niece
here, and they offer many more things to do than just a day at the
zoo, such as "Senior Keeper Programs", "Zoo Camp" and "School at
the Zoo," all events directed to adults and children with the
intent of educating them about exotic animals and wildlife. 
&lt;br /&gt;This zoo has over 30 acres for free-roaming animals that you
can see up close via the Safari Line Train and stroll though the
gardens, gift shop and children's petting zoo. 
&lt;br /&gt;A dear friend of mine and fellow animal lover, Betsy Bragg,
came to me one day and asked if I could donate some artwork to the
zoo to be a part of its fundraiser "Feast with the Beast". I felt
that I could and should do more than just that. So that is why I'm
doing this "iReport" for CNN. I hope that through my story and
photos that it will bring attention where it is greatly needed. 
&lt;br /&gt;Betsy got me in touch with one of the board members of the
zoo, Janie Switzer. And with my partner, Jeff Griffey, the four of
us took off on a photo shoot, Safari style. I can't tell you how
excited I was to see these wonderful creatures up close and
personal. And to see how hard every one at this zoo has worked to
recover from those storms. So many trees down, so many fences
destroyed, damage to property, and loss of revenue and rising
operational costs, with the change in the economy it's a lot to
deal with when you are a non-profit zoo. Every day it's face with
making sure that the animals are safe, getting them to shelter,
keeping them calm, keeping them fed, keeping them healthy, paying
the employees, maintaining and rebuilding the property, paying the
utilities...the list goes on and on. 
&lt;br /&gt;As I was asked before, to donate artwork to the zoo for
"Feast with the Beast" in September, chances are there won't be a
fund raiser to donate to. So, with the help of Jeff, Betsy,
Danyelle, Janie and the Pensacola News Journal, we are putting
together a fund raising auction on eBay next week. With the photos
that I have taken and the help of Akiens Framery, we are putting
together a dozen 11x17 signed, matted, and framed photo prints of
the animals that live at this zoo. One hundred percent of the net
profits will go directly to the The Zoo Northwest Florida to help
feed and maintain the animals, no matter what path this zoo
takes*.* 
&lt;br /&gt;After having this chance to see the zoo from a different
angle and to learn more clearly about the challenges they are faced
with, I hope this story inspires more people to help. 
&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to bid on one of our prints, you can go to
eBay. Link below.....

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to learn more about the zoo and make a
donation, you can do to the zoo's web page. Link below.....

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank CNN for giving me the chance to get this
story about The Zoo Northwest Florida out there and thank the
viewers for taking the time to watch.

      <description>Ridgecrest recieved over one and one half inches of rain Sunday in
a short period of time, triggering major flooding within the city.
Disabled police vehicles, flooded residences, businesses and road
closures were commonplace. Most people showed some form of
excitement seeing roads turn into rivers. July 20, 2008.</description>

      <title>Mayor Cory Booker on Obama, Hip-Hop, and Being Yourself</title>
      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-48006?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>I had the distinct pleasure of interviewing Mayor Cory Booker of
Newark, New Jersey on Saturday, and it was an unforgettably AMAZING
experience to say the very least! At just 39 years old, he is one
of the youngest, best, and brightest public servants in our
country, and has already achieved more than most 90 year-olds do.

      <title>THE DARK KNIGHT INSIDE - OUR DUALITY</title>
      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-48024?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>The lights went down, the fifteen minutes of trailers played. Then
the opening Warner Logo and the audience clapped.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A remorse did hang over the house as "The Dark Knight" rolled
it's way through the projector. There was the familiar communal
energy that accompanies any eagerly anticipated film, especially
one a part of a franchise as popular as Batman, but there was, of
course, an underlying current.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Ledger's first appearance was met with tangible energy that
turned, at least for me, momentarily to mourning. This was a good
man and a tremendous artist. Anyone who possessed within him the
quiet soul from Brokeback and the deranged manic Joker is a tornado
of stories. His range was obviously insanely gifted. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't help stop though and begin questioning. That
familiar inner struggle that I can only assume we all have. Are we
at all guilty in this? Are we at all responsible? Not for his
specific death, no I don't think that, but&amp;hellip;it brought forth
questions&amp;hellip;.what kind of people are we?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Now I won't bore you with a critique of "The Dark Knight",
that is not my role but I will say this about the film - it had
flaws, sure, but this is an important movie in Cinematic history
and not just because of Ledger's Joker, but for the film's honesty.
For the Dark Knight is not Christian Bale or George Clooney or the
fictional Bruce Wayne, the Dark Knight is all of us. We all have
those demons that drive us forward or underneath ground, depending
on the volume of their song. For some it might be a simple need to
please a parent for other's perhaps a more complicated set of
personal obstacles - alcoholism, divorce, anger or the worst, that
quiet resentment that builds until a young child of 17 picks up a
weapon and kills his classmates. We all have demons, what defines
us is the balance - between right and wrong - light and
dark&amp;hellip;and more importantly how we handle the grey.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But back to that question - who are we that we can mourn over
an attack as shocking as 9/11 and still applaud in glee as Joker
does some heinous act of violence. There is a particular moment in
the film that stands out - and I won't spoil it for those who have
yet to see this film - but those who have know something about a
magic trick. When that moment happened the audience gasped in
disbelief and then immediately began applauding and laughing.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Now Ledger is remarkable in the part. Staggering in his power
and frightening in his sponteity - and perhaps his performance made
Joker more human, more accessible, but why did we enjoy the
violence so much? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yes I know, it's just a movie. Believe me I know. But here I
was sitting in a theatre, watching one of the highest grossing
movies of all time starring a deceased star who plays a deranged
killer that we all secretly root for and I couldn't help but notice
the film's theme blaring in my own ear - this duality of man - how
we all can be capable of some aspect of the Joker when the right
buttons are pushed.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;That car that cuts you off. That friend that lies. That hero
that falls. The lover who cheats. The army that invades.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that's why we love super hero movies, especially in
troubled times like these. We must believe that there is someone
out there helping us make the right decisions and keeping us from
our most heinous selves. Someone to do the dirty work of cleaning
up after our footsteps. But in truth, it is not the Joker that we
are afraid of - he's obvious and extreme - it's the uncontrolled
Dark Knight within each of us.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is, it's just a film. There is no Dark Knight,
no superhero, to show us a balance and take on some dark burden and
mantel. It's up to each of us.</description>

      <title>Major flooding in Ridgecrest, California: Stills 2</title>
      <link>http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-47937?ref=feeds%2Foncnn</link>
      <description>Ridgecrest recieved over one and one half inches of rain Sunday in
a short period of time, triggering major flooding within the city.
Disabled police vehicles, flooded residences, businesses and road
closures were commonplace. According to Captain John King of the
Kern County Fire Department, "About 15 people stranded in the
American Legion building surrounded by water... inside the
building, and they weren't sure how they could get out. If they
could get out." Captain Shawn Compton of the Bureau of Land
Management Fire Department, Saltwells Station and first on scene
said, "We had 2 disabled people, one with a prosthesis leg and one
with a broken foot we had to carry out." Linda Katz, a patron at
the time the floodwaters hit said, "That door, the door that was
over there by Inyokern [Road] and the back door, we couldn't open
them. The guys tried to push them open. July 20, 2008.
